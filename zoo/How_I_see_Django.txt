1: The basic form of Django is described in the templates.
    1. These describe how the page will be presented
    2. These also describe the items that allow you to interact.
        (With the action= parameter in <form> elements)
    3. These also define what the properties for presentation are, or
        where they are obtained.

2: Then the urls.py aspect tells Django how to respond to input
    1. If you put in a form and give it an action="/Fight/"
        1. Django will look in urls.py for "/Fight/"
        2. Django will then execute the code that is in views and
            is associated with "/Fight/"
    2. This describes the actions to take upon a command

3: Finally, the views page contains the Classes, Methods and techniques
    that are required to successfully render the pages.
    1. This is where most of the work might be done
        1. Calling other packages
        2. Executing other algorithms
